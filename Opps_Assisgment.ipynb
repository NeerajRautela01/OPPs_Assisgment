What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n","  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code using objects which bundle data (attributes) and behavior (methods). It helps write reusable, modular, and maintainable code.\n","  \n","Q.2 What is a class in OOP?\n","  - A class is like a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (variables) and behaviors (methods) that its objects will have.\n","\n","Q.3 What is an object in OOP?\n","  - An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with specific characteristics. For example, if Car is a class, then a BMW car with a red color is an object. Objects store actual values in their attributes and can use the class’s methods.\n","\n","Q.4 What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n","  - Abstraction means hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features to the user. It helps to reduce complexity.\n","Encapsulation means bundling the data (variables) and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to some parts of the object using access modifiers like private or protected.\n","\n","Q.5 What are dunder methods in Python?\n","  - Dunder methods (Double UNDERscore) are special built-in methods in Python that begin and end with double underscores, such as __init__, __str__, __repr__, __add__, and __call__. They enable classes to implement certain behaviors like initialization, string representation, operator overloading, and making objects callable.\n","\n","Q.6 Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?.\n","  - Inheritance is a mechanism where one class (child or derived class) can inherit properties and behaviors from another class (parent or base class). It allows code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes. For example, a Dog class can inherit from an Animal class and reuse its speak() method while adding new behaviors.\n","\n","Q.7️ What is polymorphism in OOP?\n","  - Polymorphism means “many forms.” It allows the same method or function name to behave differently based on the object calling it. For example, the fly() method can have different implementations for a Sparrow and a Penguin. It helps achieve flexibility and interface consistency.\n","\n","Q.8 How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n","  - In Python, encapsulation is achieved by defining private variables and methods using a single underscore _ (protected) or double underscore __ (private). Access to these members is controlled using getter and setter methods, which allows validation and hiding of the internal state.\n","\n","Q.9 What is a constructor in Python?\n","  - A constructor in Python is a special method called __init__. It automatically runs when an object is created. The constructor initializes the object’s attributes and sets up its initial state.\n","\n","Q.10 What are class and static methods in Python?\n","  - A class method (decorated with @classmethod) takes cls as its first argument and works with the class itself, not with an instance. It can modify class-level variables.\n","\n","  -A static method (decorated with @staticmethod) does not take self or cls. It behaves like a regular function placed inside a class for logical grouping but does not access class or instance data.\n","\n","Q.11 What is method overloading in Python?\n","  - Python does not support traditional method overloading (same method name with different arguments) like other languages. However, you can mimic it by using default arguments, *args, or **kwargs to allow a method to handle multiple cases.\n","\n","Q.12 What is method overriding in OOP?\n","  - Method overriding is when a child class provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in the parent class. This allows the child class to change or extend the parent class’s behavior.\n","\n","Q.13 What is a property decorator in Python?\n","  - The @property decorator turns a method into a property, so you can access it like an attribute but still run code behind the scenes. It is often used to control access to private variables.\n","\n","Q.14 Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n","  - Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated through the same interface. This makes code more flexible and extensible. For example, you can loop through a list of animals and call speak() on each, without knowing the specific animal type.\n","\n","Q.15 What is an abstract class in Python?\n","  - An abstract class cannot be instantiated directly. It defines a blueprint with abstract methods (methods with no implementation) that must be implemented by child classes. Abstract classes are created using the abc module and @abstractmethod decorator.\n","\n","Q.16 What are the advantages of OOP?\n","  - Reusability: Inheritance allows using existing code.\n","\n","  - Maintainability: Encapsulation protects data and simplifies updates.\n","\n","  - Flexibility: Polymorphism allows different objects to be handled through a common interface.\n","\n","  - Modularity: Code is organized into classes and objects, making it easy to debug and test.\n","\n","Q.17 What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n","  - A class variable is shared by all instances of a class. It is defined outside the constructor.\n","\n","  - An instance variable is unique to each object and is defined inside the constructor (__init__).\n","\n","Q.18 What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n","  - Multiple inheritance is when a class inherits from more than one parent class. This allows a child class to combine features from multiple sources, but it can also lead to complexity and the “diamond problem,” which Python handles with the Method Resolution Order (MRO).\n","\n","Q.19 Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python.\n","  - __str__ returns a readable, user-friendly string representation of the object, used by print().\n","\n","__repr__ returns an unambiguous string representation meant for developers and debugging.\n","\n","Q.20 What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n","  - The super() function is used in inheritance to call a method from the parent class. It helps reuse the parent’s behavior without rewriting code and is useful in method overriding.\n","\n","Q.21 What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n","  - The __del__ method is a destructor. It is called when an object is about to be destroyed and can be used to perform cleanup operations, like closing files or releasing resources.\n","\n","Q.22 What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n","  - @staticmethod does not access class or instance data. It’s like a regular function placed inside a class.\n","\n","  - @classmethod takes cls as the first argument and can access or modify class variables. It works with the class itself.\n","\n","Q.23  How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n","  - Polymorphism works by using inheritance and method overriding. A child class can redefine a method of the parent class, and the correct method is called at runtime based on the object’s type.\n","\n","Q.24 What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n","  - Method chaining allows calling multiple methods in a single line by having each method return self. For example: obj.method1().method2().method3().\n","\n","Q.25 What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n","  - The __call__ method allows an object to be called like a function. This is useful when you want objects to behave like callable functions.\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"ATksOb78dbVd"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":29,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"l-pY7gbxZ3p-","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1754318821404,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":27,"user":{"displayName":"Neeraj Rautela","userId":"09270208799310194500"}},"outputId":"0de3c7ea-7b93-45e6-d7b4-756db586434b"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Some generic animal sound.\n","Bark!\n"]}],"source":["\n","# 1.
